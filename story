The kindhearted monkey offered him some fruits.The crocodile came back next day for more fruits, as he loved them.
As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.

The crocodile told the monkey that he had a wife and that they lived on the other side of the river.
So the kind monkey offered him some extra rose apples to take home to his wife.
The crocodileâ€™s wife loved the rose apples and made her husband promise to get her some every day.
